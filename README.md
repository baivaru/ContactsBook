# ContactsBook:
Let me start by saying I am not a web developer. Anyway do not forget the fact once a wise man said "No matter how bad you are, you are not useless. You can still be used as a **bad example**." Now its upon you to decide to go through this project or not.

I was tasked with creating a central managed address book that can be accessed via web, so I came up with this idea of creating an interface for google Contacts.
